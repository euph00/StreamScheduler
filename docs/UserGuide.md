# What is StreamScheduler? <a name='top'></a>

Have you ever opened your YouTube subscriptions page looking for live streams from your favourite channels, only to realise that the subscriptions page is a mess? The ordering of videos on the YouTube subscriptions page can often seem arbitrary, and it is often difficult to find upcoming livestreams as they are not displayed at the top of the page, resulting in users having to check the pages of each specific channel to find out if that channel has an upcoming livestream.

This is where SteamScheduler comes in. StreamScheduler is a management app for you to track YouTube livestreams of your subscriptions. This app streamlines the experience of finding livestreams, giving you unprecendented control over searching, sorting and listing all the upcoming and currently live streams that YouTube cannot do. Looking up YouTube livestreams has never been easier.
